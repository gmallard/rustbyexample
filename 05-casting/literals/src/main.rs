/*
Numeric literals can be type annotated by adding the type as a suffix, 
with the exception of usize that uses the usize suffix and isize that 
uses the isize suffix.

The type of unsuffixed numeric literals will depend on how they are used. 
If no constraint exists, the compiler will use i32 for integers, and f64 
for floating-point numbers.
