# Yet Another Rust By Example Project

## This Project

Based on http://rustbyexample.com/ of course.

A work in progress.

## Comments

I am about ... say 2/3 of the way through having all these examples done and on
github.

Yes, much of it is copy/paste.  However, I do try to take a close look at
the source code being compiled, and to try to understand what the site
intends me to learn for the given example.  At the end of this, I will at least 
have (I hope) a modicum of understanding the language.

My general notes at this time are:

* The language has a pretty steep learning curve.  But that's OK.
* Many net resident examples are out of date.  Do not expect that all you
see will even compile, much less run.
