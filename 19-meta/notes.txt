Some topics aren't exactly relevant to how you program but provide you tooling 
or infrastructure support which just makes things better for everyone. These 
topics include:

1) Documentation: Generate library documentation for users via the included 
rustdoc.
2) Testing: Create testsuites for libraries to give confidence that your library 
does exactly what it's supposed to.
3) Benchmarking: Create benchmarks for functionality to be confident that they 
run quickly.
