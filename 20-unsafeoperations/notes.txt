As an introduction to this section, to borrow from the official docs, "one 
should try to minimize the amount of unsafe code in a code base." With that in 
mind, let's get started! Unsafe blocks in Rust are used to bypass protections 
put in place by the compiler; specifically, there are four primary things that 
unsafe blocks are used for:

1) dereferencing raw pointers
2) calling a function over FFI (but this is covered in a different part of the 
book)
3) changing types through std::cast::transmute
4) inline assembly
